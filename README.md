** About One Nation One Ration Card by Govt of India: **
One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) is a scheme launched by the Government of India to provide nationwide portability of ration cards to all National Food Security Act (NFSA) beneficiaries.
This means that any NFSA beneficiary can lift their entitled foodgrains from any Fair Price Shop (FPS) in the country, using their existing ration card and biometric authentication.

ONORC is being implemented in a phased manner. As of November 2023, it has been implemented nationwide for intra-state portability (i.e., within a state) and in 36 states and union territories for inter-state portability.

**Objectives of the ONORC Scheme: **
Ensure food security for all NFSA beneficiaries, irrespective of their location in the country.
Reduce the hassle and inconvenience faced by migrant workers in accessing subsidized foodgrains.
Empower NFSA beneficiaries by giving them the choice to select their own FPS.
Improve the efficiency and transparency of the Public Distribution System (PDS).

**Benefits of ONORC**
ONORC has a number of benefits for NFSA beneficiaries, including:
Nationwide portability of ration cards: Beneficiaries can lift their entitled foodgrains from any FPS in the country, without having to obtain a new ration card.
Convenience: Beneficiaries can choose an FPS that is convenient for them, such as near their workplace or residence.
Transparency: ONORC is a technology-driven system, which ensures greater transparency and accountability in the PDS.
Empowerment: ONORC empowers beneficiaries by giving them the choice to select their own FPS and by ensuring that they have access to subsidized foodgrains wherever they are in the country.

**About the Project:**
*Overview*
Interstate portability transaction under ONORC is a feature that allows National Food Security Act (NFSA) beneficiaries to lift their entitled foodgrains from any Fair Price Shop (FPS) in the country, using their existing ration card and biometric authentication. This is a significant step towards ensuring food security for all, irrespective of their location.

*Benefits*

Interstate portability transaction under ONORC has a number of benefits for NFSA beneficiaries, including:
1.Convenience: Beneficiaries can now lift their entitled foodgrains from any FPS in the country, without having to obtain a new ration card. This is especially beneficial for migrant workers, who can now access subsidized foodgrains wherever they are in the country, without having to worry about their ration card.
2.Transparency: ONORC is a technology-driven system, which ensures greater transparency and accountability in the Public Distribution System (PDS). This means that beneficiaries can be confident that they are receiving their full entitlement of foodgrains, and that there is less scope for fraud and corruption.
3.Empowerment: ONORC empowers beneficiaries by giving them the choice to select their own FPS. This means that beneficiaries can choose an FPS that is convenient for them, such as near their workplace or residence.

**Implementation**
Interstate portability transaction under ONORC is being implemented in a phased manner. As of November 2023, it has been implemented in 36 states and union territories. The Government of India is working with the remaining states and union territories to implement interstate portability transaction under ONORC as soon as possible.

**Challenges**
There are a few challenges that need to be addressed in order to make interstate portability transaction under ONORC a success. These include:
*Integration of PDS systems: The PDS systems of all states and union territories need to be integrated so that beneficiaries can be authenticated and their entitlements verified across the country.
*Seeding Aadhaar numbers with ration cards: Aadhaar numbers need to be seeded with ration cards in order to enable biometric authentication.
*Equipping all FPSs with ePoS devices: All FPSs need to be equipped with electronic point-of-sale (ePoS) devices in order to process interstate portability transactions.
*Awareness: Beneficiaries need to be made aware of interstate portability transaction under ONORC and how to avail it.

**Steps taken to overcome the challenges**
The Government of India is taking a number of steps to overcome the challenges in implementing interstate portability transaction under ONORC, including:
*Providing financial and technical assistance to states and union territories: The Government of India is providing financial and technical assistance to states and union territories to integrate their PDS systems, equip their FPSs with ePoS devices, and seed Aadhaar numbers with ration cards.
*Launching awareness campaigns: The Government of India is launching awareness campaigns to educate beneficiaries about interstate portability transaction under ONORC and how to avail it.
*Working with civil society organizations: The Government of India is working with civil society organizations to reach out to beneficiaries and help them avail interstate portability transaction under ONORC benefits.

**Conclusion**
Interstate portability transaction under ONORC is a significant step towards ensuring food security for all, irrespective of their location. It has a number of benefits for NFSA beneficiaries, including convenience, transparency, and empowerment. The Government of India is taking a number of steps to overcome the challenges in implementing interstate portability transaction under ONORC, and with the support of all stakeholders, it can be made a grand success.
